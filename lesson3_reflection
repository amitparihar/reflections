When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case of colloborative efforts it's a good idea to keep a repository where different people can contribute. In other cases, when you are creating an open source project a remote repository would be useful. Lastly keeping your project code on a repository will ensure that you can pull your data to work on from anywhere using github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If git stays updated with all the contents of my remote repository then it would take in unfinished projects and that would create a lot of unnecessary information.
