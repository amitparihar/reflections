How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a temp file which one can use to see what changes one is making before those changes are finalized, it helps in making sure that if any change is made in terms of how we want to save and what we want to save (in bundle or all on its own), we can see that happening and make any changes if there are carry over "saving" effects from last operations
